# MissionControl File Library Plugin

This is a plugin for the [MissionControl CMS](http://github.com/jamiemill/missioncontrol). Whilst it is fairly self-contained it is really designed to be used in that context and probably won't work anywhere else.

## Features

This plugin controls uploaded files and can organise them into folders.

It can also resize images to create thumbnails at any size. 

### Need documentation for

*	size limits for resizing?
*	defining custom sizes?
*	how to insert through tinyMCE?
*	how to output a thumbnail?
*	how to upload files through other plugins?
*	webroot/files must be writable
